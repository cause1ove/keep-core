= Registration

== Stake

Stake T tokens to the Staking Provider account according to the instructions
received from your Staking Provider or 
the link:https://docs.threshold.network/guides/migrating-legacy-stakes[Threshold Network Staking Guide].

== Authorize Applications

Authorize the Random Beacon and TBTC applications.

// TODO: Add instruction

[#register-operator]
== Register Operator

Once the tokens are staked the one controlling the Staking Provider account has to
register an operator for the Random Beacon and TBTC applications.

CAUTION: An Operator for the Provider registration can be submitted just once. The
Operator address assignment cannot be updated.

If a Key File for the Staking Provider account is available the registration
can be performed from the <<register-operator-client>>.

Another way is registration from the <<register-operator-web>>.

NOTE: For the Keep Legacy stakes the Staking Provider account and Operator account are
the same.

[#register-operator-client]
=== Via Keep Client

An operator-registering transaction can be submitted with the Keep Client.

The commands that should be used are provided below.
You need to replace a few values in the commands:

* `KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_WS_URL` - an URL to the Ethereum WebSocket API,

* `STAKING_PROVIDER_KEY_FILE_PASSWORD` - a password used for the Staking Provider
Ethereum Key File encryption,

* `STAKING_PROVIDER_KEY_FILE_NAME` - a name of the Staking Provider Ethereum
Key File, that is expected to be placed inside the `KEEP_CLIENT_CONFIG_DIR` (`config/` directory).

* `OPERATOR_ADDRESS` - an Operator address that will be running the Keep Client.

Command templates for the supported applications:

* Random Beacon application (`RandomBeacon` contract)
