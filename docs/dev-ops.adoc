= Kubernetes

At Keep we run on GCP + Kubernetes. To accommodate the aforementioned 
xref:./run-keep-node.adoc#system-considerations[System Considerations]
we use the following pattern for each of our environments:

- Regional Kubernetes cluster.
- 10 Keep clients.
- A LoadBalancer Service for each client.
- A StatefulSet for each client.

You can see our Testnet Kubernetes configurations link:https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/tree/main/infrastructure/kube/keep-test[here].
