== xref:local-t-network.adoc[Setting up local T network]

For development purposes, it is convenient to set up a local Ethereum client with
a group of connected peers. A note-taken walkthrough covers the entire process
including setting up a local Ethereum client, deploying T contracts and
configuring T peers.

== Quick installation

To quickly install and start a client use the following scripts.

=== Install scripts

The `+install.sh+` script will:

* install yarn dependencies
* unlock accounts
* build contracts
* deploy contracts
* build client

The `+initialize.sh+` script will:

* mint & approve `T` tokens
* stake `T` tokens
* increase authorization for `RandomBeacon` and `WalletRegistry` applications
* register operator for `RandomBeacon` and `WalletRegistry` applications

Please refer to the script's `help` for available command arguments and environment
variables. `./install.sh --help` or `./initialize.sh --help`. Accounts unlocking
and initialization can be run outside of these scripts as standalone hardhat tasks.

To deploy and initialize contracts:

* run `./scripts/install.sh`. You need to run it only once.

* run `./scripts/initialize.sh --stake-owner <address>` for the default setup for
each client. Default setup assumes that the staking provider, operator, beneficiary,
and the authorizer all have the same addresses as the stake owner. Only the
`stake-owner` has to be unique for the default setup. The default stake amount is
`1,000,000 T` tokens. The default authorization amount is the minimum authorization
amount +
Ex. if you need to initialize a network with 3 clients using the default setup,
then run this script 3 times with a different `--stake-owner <address>`.

== Development Guidelines

There are two primary languages in the T code right now:

Go::
  Go code largely adheres to community practices where they have been decided.
  Divergences and additional tidbits are listed in the link:go-guidelines.adoc[Go
  Guidelines] document.

Solidity::
  Solidity code generally adheres to the
  https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html[Solidity style guide].
  Contracts and their functions are documented using
  https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/natspec-format.html[the
  Ethereum Natural Specification Format] (NatSpec).

== Working with Solidity contracts

The fastest and easiest way to have a local Ethereum testent is to use
https://hardhat.org/[Hardhat].


Navigate to one of the projects `solidity/ecdsa` or `solidity/random-beacon`.
You can deploy contracts executing `yarn deploy` or run tests against the local
Hardhat's network `yarn test`.
