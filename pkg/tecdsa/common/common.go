// IdentityConverter takes care of conversions between protocol-agnostic
// member indexes and TSS-specific party IDs.
//
// A different strategy for obtaining party IDs have to be used for key
// generation and signing.
//
// Distributed Key Generation:
//  1. We receive an array of 100 operators selected to the signing group by the
//     sortition pool.
//  2. Each operator has its member index assigned, based on the position in the
//     array returned from the sortition pool. selected[0] has member index = 1,
//     selected[1] has member index = 2,â€¦, selected[99] has member index = 100.
//  3. When the DKG attempt fails, some members are excluded from the next
//     attempt. The exclusion algorithm provides indexes of members excluded from
//     the next run.
//  4. During the execution of a retry of a DKG protocol, indexes are not getting
//     shifted. For example, if the original selection was [0xA, 0xB, 0xC, 0xD, 0xE]
//     and operator 0xC has been excluded from the attempt, the member indexes
//     stay as [1 (0xA), 2 (0xB), 4 (0xD), 5 (0xE)]. This allows filtering out
//     messages from excluded members.
//  5. Once DKG completes successfully, indexes of members excluded from the
//     execution must be set in EcdsaDkg.Result.misbehavedMembersIndices and
//     EcdsaDkg.Result.membersHash should have the misbehaving members filtered
//     out. When the DKG result gets approved, EcdsaDkg.dkgResult.membersHash is
//     stored on-chain.
//  6. When establishing the transaction submission order when publishing the
//     result to the chain, we take into account the original selection result
//     and we do not skip misbehaving members.
//  7. Before saving information to disk, misbehaving members are excluded from
//     the result and the member indexes are shifted. We do it to avoid
//     unnecessary delays when determining the order for publishing a signature
//     and all other responsibilities. Also, this way member indexes stored on
//     disk are the same as the ones expected on-chain by the members array hash
//     stored on-chain.
//
// Signing:
//  1. We load signing group members with the key shares from disk storage.
//  2. In case there were any misbehaving members during the key generation,
//     member indexes stored on disk are shifted (see point 7 of key generation).
//     If the successful DKG run was with member indexes
//     [1 (0xA), 2 (0xB), 4 (0xD), 5 (0xE)] as in the example in key generation
//     step 4, the member indexes stored on disk will be [1,2,3,4] but the TSS
//     party IDs stored on disk will be [PartyID(1), PartyID(2), PartyID(4),
//     PartyID(5)].
//  3. For the signing protocol, the same Party IDs as used in the key generation
//     must be used. It means that in case there were misbehaving members during
//     DKG, member index != TSS party ID.
