// Miner allows managing computationally heavy operations: stopping and resuming
// them. The client needs to generate parameters for cryptographic algorithms
// and generating these parameters requires a lot of CPU cycles. The generation
// process may starve other processes in the client when it comes to access to
// the CPU. The miner allows starting the parameter generation when no other
// processes such as key generation or signing are executed on the client. This
// way, the client that would normally be idle, can spend CPU cycles on
// computationally heavy operations and stop these operations when CPU cycles
// are needed elsewhere.
//
// There are two requirements for goroutines using the miner:
// 1. Always call Stop() before Resume(),
// 2. Never forget to call Resume().
