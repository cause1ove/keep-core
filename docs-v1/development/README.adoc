== Getting Set Up

If you're on macOS, install Homebrew and run `scripts/macos-setup.sh`. Note
that if you don't have Homebrew or you're not on macOS, the below information
details what you'll need. The script additionally sets up pre-commit hooks.

== Building

Currently the easiest way to build is using the `Dockerfile` at the root of the
repository. A simple `docker build` should get you a functioning container.

If you want to build natively, there are a few prereqs you'll need to go through.
In particular, you'll need the
https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads[protobuf
compiler].  You'll also need to install the `protoc-gen-go` toolchain,
which you can install using `go get`:

```
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
```

Run `+go generate ./.../+` from `keep-core` and if everything is fine, start the
Keep client with `go run main.go`.

== <<local-keep-network.adoc,Setting up local Keep network>>

For development purposes, it is convenient to set up local Ethereum client with
a group of connected peers. A note-taken walkthrough covers the entire process
including setting up local Ethereum client, deploying Keep contracts and
configuring Keep peers.

== Quick installation

To quickly install and start a client use the following scripts.

=== Install script

The `+install.sh+` script will:

* migrate contracts
* update client config files
* build client

The script will ask you for the password to previously created ethereum
accounts.

To start the installation execute:

....
./scripts/install.sh
....

=== Starting a client

To start a client execute:

....
./scripts/start.sh
....

The `+start.sh+` script will ask you to:

* provide ethereum password
* provide path to `keep-core` config files directory
* select a config `.toml` file for your client

== Development Guidelines

There are two primary languages in the Keep code right now:

Go::
  Go code largely adheres to community practices where they have been decided.
  Divergences and additional tidbits are listed in the link:go-guidelines.adoc[Go
  Guidelines] document.

Solidity::
  Solidity code generally adheres to the
  https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html[Solidity style guide].
  Contracts and their functions are documented using
  https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Natural-Specification-Format[the
  Ethereum Natural Specification Format] (NatSpec).

== Relay States

There is a set of threshold relay state diagrams auto-generated from this
repo's `docs` available at https://docs.keep.network/relay-states.pdf. The
images in the diagram, whose sources are at `img-src/*.tikz`, are also
available at `+https://docs.keep.network/img/generated/*.png+` (the filenames
are identical to their TikZ sources, with a `.png` suffix instead of
`.tikz`). These URLs are for the `main` version of the repo; non-`main`
branches are instead published to `+https://docs.keep.network/<branch name>/+`.

== Common problems

- Please avoid using `~` when defining `$GOBIN` location and use `$HOME` instead.
  We've been observing https://github.com/google/protobuf/issues/3355[some issues]
  with locating `protoc-gen-go` when running `go generate` and `$GOBIN`
  contained `~`.

- For Mojave, if you have a problem with missing include or missing library and
  you are sure that you have installed xcode with `xcode-select --install`. Then
  install the following package:
  `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`

== Working with Solidity contracts

The fastest and easiest way to have local Ethereum testent is to use Ganache app.
https://truffleframework.com/ganache/

You can also use a demo script to help you deploy contracts to your local testnet
and to have demo balances (token, staking and token grants) allocated between first
two accounts.

Go to `solidity` directory and run:

```
npm install
npm run demo
```
